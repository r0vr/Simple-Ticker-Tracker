# Simple Ticker Tracker

## Written by: Owen Pearson

### Project Description

A simple program I made to help me get better at Python,
as well as libraries like pandas. This program uses pandas
as well as yfinance to pull stock prices.

### How To Use

The user inputs a stock ticker and is presented with options
for various sources of data to view, such as income statements,
SEC filings, stock price history, and general company info.
These sources are also (with the exception of info) printed
to either .csv or .json files. These files can be viewed at
a later time inside the program, or via your own software.
